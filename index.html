        <p>Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a versatile and powerful code editor that has gained immense popularity among developers due to its lightweight nature, extensive customization options, and robust extension ecosystem. It supports a wide range of programming languages and offers features like syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging support, and Git integration, making it suitable for various development tasks from simple scripting to complex software projects. Setting up VS Code is straightforward: after downloading and installing it from the official website, users can further enhance its functionality by installing extensions tailored to their specific needs, such as language support, themes, and tools for cloud integration. Its intuitive interface and productivity-boosting features make it a preferred choice for developers across different platforms and development environments.</p>

        <p>A console screen, also known as a terminal or command line interface (CLI), is a text-based interface for interacting with the operating system by executing commands, running programs, and managing files. It is widely used by developers and system administrators for its efficiency and control over system processes. To open the console screen, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS, or Terminal applications on Linux. In the context of web development with JavaScript, the console is often accessed through a web browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking a webpage and selecting "Inspect" and then navigating to the "Console" tab). To print anything on the console using JavaScript, you can use the console.log method, such as console.log("Hello, World!");, which outputs the specified message to the browser's console.</p>
